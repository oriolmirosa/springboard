This was my first time attending a meetup, and overall it was a positive experience. The meeting started at 6:30pm with half an hour of socializing while eating pizza. I thought this would be a nice time to network. Unfortunately, except for a few groups of people who had come together, most attendees seemed to be by themselves on their phones and there were not many opportunities to actually meet people. I am hoping that in future meetups I will have the chance to interact with others, but it is clear that I will have to pursue this more aggressively since the setup was not very conducive to this happening spontaneously.

At 7pm the main talk began. It was a basic overview of text analysis through machine learning, starting with bag-of-words models, word2vec, and other forms of embeddings that have been developed recently. It was an interesting exploration, even if quite superficial. I asked a question about the relationship between the covered material and topic modeling. After the main event, there was one lightning talk about a new tool to identify the context in which a jupyter notebook is being run. It seemed interesting and I will certainly check the code and see if I can incorporate the tool (called [whereami](https://github.com/tonyfast/whereami)) to my workflow. The meeting ended a bit after 8pm.
